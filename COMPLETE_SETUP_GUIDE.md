# 🔧 WhatsApp Blur - Complete Setup & Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

Your WhatsApp Blur app is now ready! Here's what you need to know:

### ⌨️ New Keyboard Shortcut

**Ctrl+Alt+Q** - Easy to press with one hand (left Ctrl + left Alt + Q)

❌ **OLD:** Ctrl+Win+B (was conflicting with WhatsApp bold text)  
✅ **NEW:** Ctrl+Alt+Q (no conflicts, easy single-hand operation)

---

## 🔐 Privacy Permissions Setup

### The Problem You Encountered

When you checked the privacy settings, only Microsoft Teams and WhatsApp appeared in the app list, but our "WhatsApp Blur" app wasn't there. This is **completely normal** for desktop applications!

### ✅ The Solution

**Desktop apps like ours are controlled by a master toggle, not individual app permissions.**

#### Method 1: Direct Access (Fastest)

1. Press **Windows + R**
2. Type: `ms-settings:privacy-graphicscaptureprogrammatic`
3. Press **Enter**
4. **Enable both toggles:**
   - ✅ "Let apps access graphics capture"
   - ✅ **"Let desktop apps access graphics capture"** ← This is the one that matters!

#### Method 2: Through Settings Menu

1. Open **Windows Settings** (Windows + I)
2. Go to **Privacy & security**
3. Click **Screenshots and screen recording**
4. **Enable both toggles:**
   - ✅ "Screenshots and screen recording access"
   - ✅ "Let apps take screenshots and record the screen"
   - ✅ **"Let desktop apps take screenshots and record the screen"** ← This controls our app!

## 🔍 Why Our App Doesn't Appear in the List

**This is by design and completely normal:**

- **UWP Apps** (Microsoft Store apps) = Individual permissions ✅ Listed individually
- **Desktop Apps** (.exe files like ours) = Master toggle ✅ Controlled by "Let desktop apps..." setting

**Examples of desktop apps:** Chrome, Firefox, Discord, Zoom, OBS Studio, and our WhatsApp Blur app.

## 🧪 Test Your Setup

After enabling the permissions:

1. **Restart the WhatsApp Blur app** if it's running
2. **Open WhatsApp**
3. **Press Ctrl+Alt+Q** to toggle blur
4. **You should see:**
   - Blur overlay appears over WhatsApp
   - Move mouse over WhatsApp to temporarily remove blur
   - System tray icon shows blur status

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Permission Denied" or No Blur Appears

- ✅ **Check:** "Let desktop apps access graphics capture" is enabled
- ✅ **Try:** Run as Administrator (right-click → Run as administrator)
- ✅ **Restart:** Windows (if permissions were just changed)

### Wrong Window Gets Blurred

- ✅ **Close:** Any other apps with "WhatsApp" in the name
- ✅ **Check:** Only WhatsApp Desktop or WhatsApp Web is running

### Shortcut Not Working

- ✅ **New shortcut:** Ctrl+Alt+Q (not Ctrl+Win+B anymore)
- ✅ **Conflict check:** Make sure no other apps use Ctrl+Alt+Q
- ✅ **Focus:** Click somewhere outside WhatsApp first, then try the shortcut

### Blur Looks Wrong

- ✅ **DPI:** Try setting display scale to 100% in Windows Display settings
- ✅ **Multiple monitors:** Test on your primary monitor first
- ✅ **WhatsApp position:** Try moving WhatsApp to different screen positions
