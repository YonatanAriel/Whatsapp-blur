```

## 🔧 Manual Permission Grant (If App Still Not Visible)

If you still can't find "WhatsApp Blur" in Settings, you can manually grant permissions:

### Option A: Registry Permission Fix

```powershell
# Run as Administrator in PowerShell:
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Privacy\CapabilityAccessManager\ConsentStore\graphicsCaptureProgrammatic" -Name "WhatsAppBlur" -Value "Allow" -PropertyType String -Force
```

### Option B: Python Global Permission

Since the app runs through Python, grant permissions to Python:

1. Settings → Privacy & security → Screenshots and apps
2. Find "Python" in the list
3. Toggle **ON** the permission

## 🚀 Quick Test

**The blur IS working**, you just need permissions:

1. **Start the app**: Run `C:\WhatsAppBlur\WhatsAppBlur.bat`
2. **Test the shortcut**: Press `Ctrl+Win+B`
3. **Check WhatsApp**: You should see blur appearing!

## 🎉 Summary
