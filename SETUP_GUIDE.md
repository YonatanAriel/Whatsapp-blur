# 🔐 WhatsApp Blur - Quick Setup Guide

## ✅ WHAT THE INSTALLER DOES:

- ✅ Installs to `C:\Program Files\WhatsApp Blur\`
- ✅ Creates Windows icon and Start Menu shortcut
- ✅ Sets up auto-start (runs automatically on Windows startup)
- ✅ Changes keyboard shortcut to **Ctrl+Alt+B** (no WhatsApp conflict!)
- ✅ Registers as proper Windows application for privacy settings

## 🚀 AFTER INSTALLATION:

### 1. **RESTART YOUR COMPUTER**

- This is required for the app to appear in Windows Privacy Settings

### 2. **Grant Privacy Permissions** (ONE TIME ONLY):

```
Windows + I → Settings
Privacy & security → Camera → ✅ Let desktop apps access camera
Privacy & security → Microphone → ✅ Let desktop apps access microphone
Privacy & security → Screenshots and apps → ✅ Let desktop apps take screenshots
```

**Look for "WhatsApp Blur" in the app list and enable it!**

### 3. **THAT'S IT!**

- App runs automatically in background
- Use **Ctrl+Alt+B** to toggle blur
- Hover over blur to temporarily see through it
- Right-click system tray icon for options

## 🎯 USAGE:

- **Ctrl+Alt+B** = Toggle blur on/off
- **Hover** = Temporarily reveal content
- **System Tray** = Right-click for options
- **Auto-start** = Runs on Windows startup automatically

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING:

- **No blur visible?** → Check privacy permissions & restart computer
- **App not in privacy settings?** → Restart computer after installation
- **DPI scaling issues?** → Set display scaling to 100% temporarily
- **WhatsApp not detected?** → Move WhatsApp to primary monitor

## 📞 KEYBOARD SHORTCUT CHANGED:

- **OLD**: `Ctrl+Shift+B` (conflicted with WhatsApp bold text)
- **NEW**: `Ctrl+Alt+B` (no conflicts!)

---

**After restart + privacy permissions = Just press Ctrl+Alt+B anytime! 🎉**
